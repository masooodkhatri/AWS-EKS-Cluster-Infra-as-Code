## Features

- **Production-Ready**: Deploy a fully functional EKS cluster tailored for production workloads.
- **Customizable Node Groups**: Define multiple node groups with different instance types and sizes.
- **Networking Options**: Easily configure VPC, subnets, and security groups.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Manage your cloud resources with Terraform, ensuring reproducibility and version control.
- **Scalability**: Scale your applications effortlessly with Kubernetes orchestration.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine. Use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/masooodkhatri/AWS-EKS-Cluster-Infra-as-Code.git
```

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

### Configuration

1. **AWS Credentials**: Configure your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

2. **Terraform Variables**: Modify the `variables.tf` file to set your desired configurations, such as region, node types, and desired capacity.

3. **Initialize Terraform**: Navigate to the project directory and run:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

4. **Plan the Deployment**: Check what Terraform will create:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

5. **Apply the Configuration**: Deploy the EKS cluster with:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

## Usage

Once your EKS cluster is up and running, you can manage your Kubernetes resources using `kubectl`. To connect to your cluster, run:

```bash
aws eks --region <region> update-kubeconfig --name <cluster_name>
```

Replace `<region>` and `<cluster_name>` with your specific values.

### Accessing the Dashboard

To access the Kubernetes dashboard, deploy it using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.5.1/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml
```

Then, create a service account and cluster role binding:

```bash
kubectl create serviceaccount dashboard -n kubernetes-dashboard
kubectl create clusterrolebinding dashboard-admin --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kubernetes-dashboard:dashboard
```

To access the dashboard, run:

```bash
kubectl proxy
```

Then, visit [http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/](http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/) in your browser.

## Customization

This repository allows for extensive customization. Here are some key areas you can modify:

- **Node Group Configuration**: Adjust the instance types and scaling policies in the `node_groups.tf` file.
- **Networking**: Customize VPC settings in `vpc.tf` to fit your organizationâ€™s requirements.
- **IAM Roles**: Modify the IAM roles in `iam.tf` to grant the necessary permissions for your applications.

Feel free to explore the Terraform files and make adjustments as needed.

## Architecture

The architecture of this EKS cluster follows best practices for cloud-native applications. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

- **VPC**: A dedicated Virtual Private Cloud with public and private subnets.
- **EKS Control Plane**: Managed by AWS, providing a highly available and scalable Kubernetes control plane.
- **Node Groups**: EC2 instances running the Kubernetes worker nodes.
- **Load Balancers**: Automatically provisioned to manage traffic to your applications.
- **Security Groups**: Configured to control inbound and outbound traffic to your resources.
